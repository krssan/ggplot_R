For this assignment, read in the Telco churn data set in the data folder and do the following:

1. Split the data into training and testing sets
2. Build at least 2 models trying to predict the outcome variable, "Churn." Our goal here is to try to predict which of Telco's members will churn or those that are more likely to churn than others. Think about how Telco would use the results of this model.
3. Show the metrics and important variables, if applicable, for each model.
4. Compare the models and decide on a "winner."
5. Turn the Rmd and HTML in on Gitlab and Canvas under the Assignment_3 project.
